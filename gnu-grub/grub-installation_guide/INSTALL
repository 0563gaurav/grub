/* Important Notes on  Installation of grub */
NOTE 1.: *  In order to install grub as your bootloader , you need to first install the grub system and utilities under the operating system . You can od this either from the source tarball or from  OS packages.
NOTE 2.: * After you have  done this , you need to install the bootloader on a drive (Flppy or hard-disk) by using the utility grub-install on a unix-like OS.

NOTE 3.: * Grub comes with boot images , which are normally put in the directory " /usr/lib/grub/<cpu>-<platform>" ( For BIOS based machines "/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc").
Hareafter. the  directory , where GRUB images are initially palced ( normally "/usr/lib/grub/<cpu>-<platform>" ) will be called the image directory , and the directory where the the bootloader needs to find them ( usually "/boot") will be called boot directory.



/* Installation procedure */
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* In-order to install grub under the unix-like os ( such as GNU ) , invoke the program ' grub-install ' as root privilages:
NOTE: The usage of the this command is very simple . you only need to specify one argument to the program , namely , where to install the bootloader. The argument has to be a device file ( like '/dev/hda') For example , under linux the following will install grub into the MBR of first IDE disk:
	# grub-install /dev/sda 
  Likewise , under GNU/Hurd , this has the same effect:
	# grub-install /dev/hd0

NOTE: But all the above  examples assumes that grub should put images under the '/boot' directory . If you want grub to put images under a directory other than '/boot', you need to specify the option '--boot-directory '.The typical usages is that you create a grub boot floopy with a filesystem . Example :
	# mke2fs /dev/fd0
	# mount -t ext3 /dev/fd0 /mnt
	# mkdir /mnt/boot
NOTE: The important thing is that , you removable media must have at least two partition , first partition of max of 512M , it must be formatted as fat32 and mounted
 under the /mnt/boot/elf , second partition of 10GB or more should be created and formatted in any filesystem.
	# grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/fd0
	# umount /mnt
** Some BIOS's have bugs od exposing the forst partition of usb drive as floopy instead of exposing the USB drive as a hard drive (they call it USB-FDD). In such case , you need to like this :
	#losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/sdb1
	#mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/usb
	# grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/usb/bugbios --force --allow-floppy /dev/loop0
** this does not conflict with standard install as long as they are sepearte directory.

NOTE: On EFI systems for fixed disk install you have to mount EFI system partition . If you mount it at '/boot/efi' then you do not need any special argument.
	# grub-install
     Otherwise you need to specify where your EFI system partition is mounted .
	#grub-install --efi-directory=/mnt/boot/efi --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdb

/* making a grub bootable CD-ROM */
NOTE: 1. Grub supports no emulation mode in the EI Torito specification . This means that you can use the the whole CD-ROM  from grub and you don't have make a fllopy and hard-disk images file , which can cause the compatibility problem.

NOTE: 2. For booting from a CD-ROM , GRUB uses a special images called 'cdboot.img' ,which is concatenated with 'core.img'. the core.img used for this should be build at least 'iso9660' and 'biosdisk' modules. Your bootable CD-ROM will usually also need to include a configuration file 'grub.cfg' na dsome other modules.
